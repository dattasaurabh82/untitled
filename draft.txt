thank god for lunch breaks
because i'm totally convinced
that somebody sold my coworker his soul at gamestop

but serious,
justin bieber is around the corner--
i want to throw a paper plane at him

justin bieber 
i don't love you but 
i do wonder what you think of anime




>>>
i am in a constant state of pancake 
	i mean panic

whether about the government paycheck i'm waiting to get in time for rent or
why the original us dub of sailor moon is so homophobic
	why would anyone want to hide such a cute couple
	michiru and haruka i'm totally with you
	babes like babes it's only natural
	and everyone likes babes with teal hair
	obviously

yeah this shit is real to me
i love anime and i hate you
stop judging me

i wanna get 'welcome to windows 98' tattooed on my ass
and no one can stop me

down with my soul and the man etc etc
impale me on a black censor bar
hentai is forever

**************

pocket full of money
and devoid of all common sense
	siri what is sense

i'm judging you based on how pimped out your polly pocket mansion is
	i thought, age 12--
	and now
i'm judging you based on whether or not you understand dakimakura

dakimakura dakimakura

so far today

two people have said

a computer could easily replace you

cool thanks




if a computer writes better poetry than me 
so be it



talent scares me and so do people
poets scare me too, but so does lightning and math and biology
and everyday activities including but not limited to everything

(the truth is that computers are the most honest things in the world

but you don't have to agree with me 
you don't even have to read this poem


i know you are but what am i


									i see the opus in your eye)


spicy wings in july at boka with watermelon soju for the first time
and drunk at decibel again
drunk again what else is new
with emmett and diego what else is new
the lesson is that some friends are a vacation wasteland
a cruel reality check that i hadn't even been living or eating the right brand of cereal 

summer is a supernova splash
turn up the volume i love this part
it's the positive universe charged up on trader joe's wine for $3 whenever i want
i refer to myself as a technophile in a moment of overwhelming word vomit and kiss a programmer
people watching is essentially lurking internet forums in real life

i relax in a cab
watching a midtown club defiled by pop culture from the window seat 

never have i ever known how to
be a functional member of society

my mom always told me 'keep to yourself,'
'just nuke a potato' she would say

i darkened my own freckles anyways

that was the biggest risk i took

what is money 
what is life 
how am i even alive
where's the wine 

i can't afford to live in my own apartment 
so i'm moving in with the internet

my life is an emergency and so is yours
	which leads me to believe that i should legally change my name to something threatening like DRAGONSLUT

/////////////
heaven is a place on habbo hotel but not on earth
heaven is definitely not on the bus
it's not in philly and it's not in the matrix
i'd rather go to the matrix than heaven anyways

a person passes through history on a google search for truth

while i walk around soho 
which is always like super models-- 
cut to me in a sailor moon crop top

very different from being 12 at contempo 
with mom in black heels, tall and gorgeous 
emerging from a jungle of dress racks
with the last pair of size 0 acid wash jeans

rouge red lips and eyelashes for miles
fight evil and dress chic
moms are forever for better or worse

her annual gift was barbie 
or many barbies

one time i was playing sex with ken
until by accident i ripped ken's leg off
which kind of killed the mood

i was in aol cybersex chat rooms before i knew what sex was

now i know even less about it
my bedroom is an anime bachelor pad
and here i am drinking a cocktail called
'the corpse reviver #2'

i hereby apologize to anyone and everyone i have ever kissed

namaste

please hold on while i randomly read yahoo answers
in search of enlightenment

what could be more zen than the internet

i don't know but my dad did call to ask when my birthday is
	
	today, i said
	and he said,
	oh right

yup dad, just like the last 22 years


>>>>>>>>



there are many things in this world including but not limited to
my complete collection of britney spears special edition perfume bottles

so please excuse me
while i read nintendo power at this rave

last year i partied this year 
i will party and i
will party again 
next year and next year and

...


you know, i'm not trying to trick anyone into thinking that i act my age--
	send me a sincere love letter drawn in kid pix
	or a cupcake
	whatever works

 
**********


i facetime with rian and eat cheese at work
she is falling in love nearby the higgs boson
	and geneva and the house wine at cern

she said
there's a little glitter gif in all of us
								etc



meet me in the library she said

	i mean the computer lab
	
		because	my autobigraphy will be an ebook and so will yours




i don't understand how to deal with real life anymore
which is why i have this mood ring

and i'm so fucking stressed after finding out that there's no color for 'overworked'

professor, 
	  where do i register for profound happiness?




...
april flowers bring may depression
and pollen and shit

i'm using my laptop case as a plate because 
i'm an adult

and i get existential 
in the dressing room at american apparel by myself

i am a hunter and a forager
for cute shorts on sale for half off

i celebrate holidays i don't believe in
and write poetry at the end of the west bar

cut to me sprawled luxuriously in bed eating chocolate dipped strawberries, 
the cat yawns in a dim and sensual light-- 
i am watching anime



...



sometimes i wish i was a geocities page
unconscious and safe
on a california harddrive

is there a plastic surgery for that?






i am just trying to be a normal girl
and according to cosmo that requires
chunky as heck mascara

they say:
trip and fall into his chest
	say, DAMN your pecs are harder
	than a solid brick wall
	and then, finally,
	'remember to breathe' when Making Out. 
	
	Wow I Never Knew That


dear cosmo,
	
please hire me for your shitty copywriter position

peace&love

nina






i keep my feelings bottled up
in a four loko full of angst,
and a dash of sass in my sauvignon

i'm getting so hammered tonight, shaped, 
formed, or ornamented by a metalworker's hammer: 
a hammered bowl of brass; hammered gold,
can't wait

i don't want to ever move again so who's
coming over to feed me oreos

seriously if i don't eat some chocolate right now
i'm going to have a panic attack

it's really risky to talk to anyone irl 
because they could be a hater or 
even an animorph 
you just never know

wear sunglasses at night to protect oneself from a dark and lonely world

or not and hide your face in a smartphone

you know, whatever works

it's thursday night and the carnival is blasting in my window

wandering through it alone, recording light-shows on my phone--
the cops stand lazily by and fashionistas 
ride the ferris wheel in heels 

i'll live off jungle juice and champagne
	says my friend spending his last 20
	in a bodega last month
	i remember
	and then we sat on the roof and you mooned the camera 
	by the light of the moon



--if i could, 
i would lock all of my friends up 
in a vault under the brooklyn bridge 
so they wouldn't leave me, 
i am a stable person nice to m----------------







my stripper name is croissant
wait what are we doing in olive garden

this poem is called
SHOTS IN THE CAB

and that poem is called
OLD SPICE ON THE DESK

welcome to my fishbowl head

my finland head
	where i eat some kind of cheesy bread stick in a hotel bed
	actually it could be anything for all i know

i haven't slept in 30 hours and i'm drinking a beer called 'cough'

cut to me blacked out in the lobby with a fistful of snack meats
from the breakfast buffet that i dream of to this day


>>>
events on my calendar are 
1pm apartment viewing, 
2pm egg hipsters, 
3pm crying, 
4pm chew on glass, 
5pm henshin into ninja, 
6pm vanish

my resume is a list of 
every video game i've ever beaten and
anime i've watched
and my pokemon card collection
so who wants to hire me

i'm a very well-rounded person 
circular-- globe-like, even 
I am a perfectly round geometrical object 
in three-dimensional space

but according to my mom i'm 
'goth'
because i like lisa frank
paint my nails black
and eat vegan food

her first reaction to my tattoo
'are you a liberal'

yahoo answers will my mom ever understand me
???

she called me recently to ask
	nina
	how do you stalk people on the internet?

i guess i probably do seem like someone that
would be good at stalking people on the internet

i'm wearing crop tops mom are you proud
	i hope so because
	i found them in your closet

thank god my mom worries about me

because
the sky is just our world blue screening

and i don't know where else to go
other than cyberspace

(...turns out
instagram of my soul is just a black square
no filter)

good night moon
good night sailor moon
good night cat, ps3, special edition wii
good night grip on reality

good night kawaii moon and other kawaii shit

twinkle twinkle la la la
la la la la la la la

star light, star bright
i'm fucking tired where is the coffee

someday you'll wake up and
find yourself in a cyberpunk romance

in which case i suggest
you dress like you're surfing the net

i wanna watch youtube videos with
you until we fall asleep
snug as a spreadsheet

1d, 2d, 3d kissing

i can see the ocean over your shoulder
and the waves scrolling by

------->this would never happen

	the internet makes me happy
	because i don't have to face your face
	when we miscommunicate--------------------------->

i'm not actually using you for your dragonball z dvds

the feelings written here are hard to see
if you're running windows 95

try linux instead



*:･ﾟ✧*:･ﾟ✧*:･ﾟ✧*:･ﾟ✧*:･ﾟ


my life is
a love letter to the internet

it's a suburban legend written in
terminal on May 20th
while everyone looks up
in unison
at the eclipse hovering
over new york

my life is 
a quiet road at night:
summer solstice and
amphibians crossing
the street 
ecstatic in
muddy ponds--
they are safe from the 
headlights that
seldom pass, unlike my
bedroom in brooklyn where
the lights are
always passing

my life is an
excuse to tear clouds down
and arrange them into poems
formless enough for words

it's me sitting in the park watching
everyone, wondering
who is a brony
and which couples
are on okcupid dates

my life is a search for people
who want to go swimming and
talk poetry with me
who want to drink iced coffee
with me
and get tattoos with me

a search for anyone to do
literally anything with me


>>>>>>>>>>>>


in what programming language
do i speak to speak with you

i'm scared that i can't understand 

communication hurts my eyes
because i'm always looking down
at my phone

it's easier to do with background music
filling in the conversation
like madlibs

sit across the table from me
and we can just text

you asked
what is html for kissing
and i said
i dunno
just follow your kokoro

my heart is in your hard drive
so please be careful



/////
ok this week is going to suck
it's already raining and my
free donut receipt is ruined

they gave me some rocky road ice cream instead--
lots of sand, mud, quartz, 
horse poop, gasoline

hey nina, your tamagotchi is dead 
what's wrong with you




i wish i was a teen i wish i was a 
teen i wish i was a teen i 
wish i was a teen i wish i was a teen 
i wish i was a teen i wish i was a teen i

danced so hard my purse broke

the next morning i woke up
opened my phone and
every internet tab was tentacle hentai

good morning pile of clothes on the
floor which i don't remember
ripping off
and where did that dirt stain come from

today i will lounge in my bed with a 
bag of popcorn and a liter of coke
while i watch society crumble
between commercial breaks

long live the weekend



////////
i opened up a microsoft word document and
clippy krumped onto the screen--
'fucking hipster,' he sneered
////////



this guy on yahoo answers 
is saying that black holes lead to nothing
when i know 
for a FACT 
that they lead to anime

ehow do i rip a hole in space time
because the world is too small now
and i want to set it free

it's pretty cool that we're just hanging out on the internet
living vastly different lifestyles all over the world--

and
if i see one more girl
in a skin-tight r2d2 dress 
on tumblr
i'm going to end my fucking miserable life





 ＿〆(。。)




	mapquest search
	where is a nice seascape
	to escape
	my looming inbox







		i am a polygon and you are a moron

pretty girls are online in panties and 
slipping in piles of font effects

they're looking into webcams eating
strawberry frosted pop-tarts

the pretty girl's so addicted to the internet
that she forgets to breathe

she asks
how do i convert this The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time cartridge into a bong™
	among other things

i'm not talking about anyone
	pretty girl

	not any one pretty girl

so hug her hard until she pixilates



she walked into an abercrombie&fitch, 
picked up some $80 shorts 
and started experiencing inexplicable thoughts 
of suicide, arson, defenestration etc

there she is now
breathing heavily into a dorito bag
and watching hulk hogan reality television program, 
etc
her anxiety is relieved
the secret is cablevision




...
wish i was still in high school 
so that whenever anyone called me a nerd i could be like 
'well i'm fucking popular on twitter 
so go eat coal'

and now that i'm watching the world
from behind a bookshelf
i wonder
what's a gigabyte taste like

a byte of tylonol
a byte of bread and butter
a byte of porn

i wish i was a hyperlink on an angelfire webpage 
circa 1995
and not crouched in the grass
with an ice cream cone 

it's summer and 
this poem doesn't rhyme but
who gives a fuck




//////////
*eats organic cereal* ugh *goes to a poetry reading* ehg *goes 
home to williamsburg* sdkj *talks to my only friend cat* guh 
*glasses* henjhd 
//////////

is it slutty to slowly disassemble an oreo 
just so you can eat the cream with only your tongue or no

if you have a problem with that
then just go die in a dark hole or something

i fucking hate assholes
may the triforce not be with you

i'm boycotting everything in this world except
brooklyn summer ale
and the flask decorated in
lisa frank ocean life stickers
strapped to my thigh

and from now on
when someone asks me where i work
i'm going to
literally pull out a knife and say
'team rocket mother fucker'

p.s.

will they shoot me if i throw a pokeball at the white house?

i'm a full grown adult with a
mattress on the floor
are you prepared to spend the
rest of your life
emotionally invested in an
iced chai

it's 11am and my only hope is this reeses mini cup
it's fine i have a salary and benefits
a macbook air and
i ate a box of cheese crackers in two days flat
it must be an omen that i will die alone
but it's like
whatever

like when you are zen
but actually chewing the polish off your own nails

in any case, i think i'll
trespass the cafe
where everyone is beautiful and
changing the world with a single
earth shattering click
because i want to 
be cool too

i wear crop tops to
professional events and
listen to rave music at Staples
hi-chew for breakfast
sega dreamcast catcher
wake up and
smell the 
neighbors smoking
cloves

'this view is extraordinary'
i sigh and
stare deeply
into the horizon of my 
macbook desktop,
the sun uploading
slowly into day
