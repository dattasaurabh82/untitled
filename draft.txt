thank god for lunch breaks
because i'm totally convinced
that my boss bought his soul 
at gamestop

but seriously,
thank god for lunch breaks
because justin bieber is around the corner
and i want to throw a paper plane at him

justin bieber 
i don't love you but 
i do wonder what you think of anime

so far today

two people have said:

a computer could easily replace you

cool thanks



if a computer writes better poetry than me 
so be it



(the truth is that computers are the most honest things in the world

but you don't have to agree with me 
you don't even have to read this poem)

...
people watching is essentially lurking internet forums in real life

relax in a cab
and watch the midtown clubs defiled by pop culture pass by from the window seat 

never have i ever known how to
be a functional member of society

my mom always told me 'keep to yourself,'
'just nuke a potato' she would say

i darkened my own freckles anyways

that was the biggest risk i took today

what is money 
what is life 
how am i even alive
where's the wine 

i can't afford to live in my own apartment 
so i'm moving in with the internet

my life is an emergency and so is yours
	which leads me to believe that i should legally change my name to something threatening like DRAGONSLUT
														ψ(｀w´)ψ

or dakimakura

dakimakura dakimakura

dig a ditch and throw me in with all the dakimakura

KAWAII HAS PERISHED press space bar to continue
THE PARTY IS OVER press space bar to continue
SERIOUSLY GET OUT press space bar to continue



/////////////
heaven is a place on habbo hotel but not on earth
heaven is definitely not on the bus
it's not in philly and it's not in the matrix
i'd rather go to the matrix than heaven anyways
////////////




a person passes through history on a google search for truth

meanwhile i walk around soho 
which is always like super models-- 
cut to me oblivious
in a sailor moon crop top

very different from being 12 at contempo 
with mom in black heels, tall and gorgeous 
emerging from a jungle of dress racks
with the last pair of size 0 acid wash jeans

rouge red lips and eyelashes for miles
fight evil and dress chic
moms are forever for better or worse

her annual gift was barbie 
or many barbies

and one time i was playing sex with ken
until by accident i ripped ken's leg off
which kind of killed the mood

i was in aol cybersex chat rooms before i knew what sex was

now i know even less about it
my bedroom is an anime bachelor pad
and here i am drinking a cocktail called
'the corpse reviver #2'

i hereby apologize to anyone and everyone i have ever kissed

namaste




(' ')






please hold while i randomly read yahoo answers
in search of enlightenment

what could be more zen than the internet?

i don't know, but my dad did call to ask when my birthday is
	
	today, i said
	and he said,
	oh right

yup dad, just like the last 22 years




you know, i'm not trying to trick anyone into thinking that i act my age--
	send me a sincere love letter drawn in kid pix
	or a cupcake
	whatever works

…   ……    … ..

i don't understand how to deal with real life anymore
which is why i have this mood ring

and i'm so fucking stressed after finding out that there's no color for 'overworked'



professor, 
	  where do i register for profound happiness?




...
april flowers bring may depression
and pollen and shit

i'm using my laptop case as a plate because 
i'm an adult

and i get existential 
in the dressing room at american apparel by myself

i am a hunter and a forager
for cute shorts on sale for half off

i celebrate holidays i don't believe in
and write poetry at the end of the west bar

cut to me sprawled luxuriously in bed eating chocolate dipped strawberries, 
the cat yawns in a dim and sensual light-- 
i am watching anime



...



sometimes i wish i was a geocities page
unconscious and safe
on a california harddrive

is there a plastic surgery for that?



*sigh*



i am just trying to be normal
and according to cosmo that requires
chunky as heck mascara

they say:
trip and fall into his chest
	say, DAMN your pecs are harder
	than a solid brick wall
	and then, finally,
	'remember to breathe' when Making Out. 
	
	Wow I Never Knew That


dear cosmo,
	
please hire me for your shitty copywriter position

peace&love

nina



my resume is a list of 
every video game i've ever beaten and
anime i've watched
and my pokemon card collection--
so who wants to hire me

i'm a very well-rounded person 
circular-- globe-like, even 
I am a perfectly round geometrical object 
in three-dimensional space

but according to my mom i'm 
'goth'
because i like lisa frank
paint my nails black
and eat vegan food

her first reaction to my tattoo
'are you a liberal'

yahoo answers will my mom ever understand me
???

she called me recently to ask
	nina
	how do you stalk people on the internet?

i guess i probably do seem like someone that
would be good at stalking people on the internet

i'm wearing crop tops mom are you proud
	i hope so because
	i found them in your closet

thank god my mom worries about me

because
the sky is just our world blue screening

and i don't know where else to go
other than cyberspace

(...turns out
instagram of my soul is just a black square anyways
no filter)

good night moon
good night sailor moon
good night cat, ps3, special edition wii
good night grip on reality

good night kawaii moon and other kawaii shit

star light, star bright
i'm so fucking tired good night

()

my life is
a love letter to the internet

it's a suburban legend written in
terminal on May 20th
while everyone looks up
in unison
at the eclipse hovering
over new york

my life is 
a quiet road at night:
summer solstice and
amphibians crossing
the street 
ecstatic in
muddy ponds--
they are safe from the 
headlights that
seldom pass, unlike my
bedroom in brooklyn where
the lights are
always passing

my life is an
excuse to tear clouds down
and arrange them into poems
formless enough for words

it's me sitting in the park watching
everyone, wondering
who is a brony
and which couples
are on okcupid dates

my life is a search for people
who want to go swimming and
talk poetry with me
who want to drink iced coffee
with me
and get tattoos with me

a search for anyone to do
literally anything with me

in what programming language
do i speak to speak with you

i'm scared that i can't understand 

communication hurts my eyes
because i'm always looking down
at my phone

it's easier to do with background music
filling in the conversation
like madlibs

sit across the table from me
and we can just text

you asked
what is html for kissing
and i said
i dunno
just follow your kokoro

i wanna watch youtube videos with
you until we fall asleep
snug as a spreadsheet

i can see the ocean over your shoulder
and the waves scrolling by

i'm not actually using you for your dragonball z dvds

the feelings written here are hard to see
if you're running windows 95

try linux instead



*:･ﾟ✧*:･ﾟ✧*:･ﾟ✧*:･ﾟ✧*:･ﾟ




ok this week is going to suck
it's already raining, my
free donut receipt is ruined

and some bro on yahoo answers 
is saying that black holes lead to nothing
when i know 
for a FACT 
that they lead to anime

ehow do i rip a hole in space time
because the world is too small
and i want to set it free





 ＿〆(。。)




	mapquest search
	where is a nice seascape
	to escape
	my looming inbox







		i am a polygon and you are a moron

pretty girls are online in panties and 
slipping in piles of font effects

they're looking into webcams eating
strawberry frosted pop-tarts

the pretty girl's so addicted to the internet
that she forgets to breathe

she asks
how do i convert this The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time cartridge into a bong™
	among other things

she walked into an abercrombie&fitch, 
picked up some $80 shorts 
and started experiencing inexplicable thoughts 
of suicide, arson, defenestration etc

there she is now
breathing heavily into a dorito bag
and watching hulk hogan reality television program, 
etc
her anxiety is relieved
the secret is cablevision




...
i wish i was still in high school 
so that whenever anyone called me a nerd i could be like 
'well i'm fucking popular on twitter 
so go eat coal'

but now that i'm watching the world
from behind a bookshelf
i wonder
what's a gigabyte taste like

i wish i was a hyperlink on an angelfire webpage 
circa 1995
and not crouched in the grass
with an ice cream cone 

it's summer and 
this poem doesn't rhyme but
who gives a fuck

//////////
*eats organic cereal* ugh *goes to a poetry reading* ehg *goes 
home to williamsburg* sdkj *talks to my only friend cat* guh 
*glasses* henjhd 
//////////

i'm boycotting everything in this world except
brooklyn summer ale
and the flask decorated in
lisa frank ocean life stickers
strapped to my thigh

from now on
when someone asks me where i work
i'm going to
literally pull out a knife and say
'team rocket mother fucker'

p.s.

will they shoot me if i throw a pokeball at the white house?





i opened up a microsoft word document
clippy krumped onto the screen--
'fucking hipster,' he sneered

it's 11am and my only hope is this reeses mini cup
it's fine i have a salary and benefits
a macbook air and
i ate a box of cheese crackers in two days flat
it must be an omen that i will die alone
but it's like
whatever

like when you are zen
but actually chewing the polish off your own nails

in any case, i think i'll
trespass the cafe
where everyone is beautiful and
changing the world with a single
earth shattering click
because i want to 
be cool too

i wear crop tops to
professional events and
listen to rave music at Staples
hi-chew for breakfast
sega dreamcast catcher
wake up and
smell the 
neighbors smoking
cloves

'this view is extraordinary'
i sigh and
stare deeply
into the horizon of my 
macbook desktop,
the sun slowly uploading
into day
