i just darkened my own freckles that was the biggest risk i took today ugh what is money what is life how am i even alive
where's the wine can't afford to live in my apartment so i'm moving in with the internet

if prince charming isn't weak to anime girls in thigh-highs then he's certainly not part of my dystopian fantasy

my brother in 6th grade on the path to become the perfect male clone of myself
	emotional breakdown in the bathroom after first middle school dance:
	how will i ever start a family at this rate?

i told him to take up parkour or program, either way

my life is an emergency and so is yours
	which leads me to believe that i should legally change my name to something threatening like DRAGONSLUT

the office soundtrack is a mix of mech anime and ambient keyboards
someone sold that guy his soul at gamestop
and now he's stuck in permanent brock cosplay
god i'm fucking bored of writing about work
and writing at work
please drop me off on the side of the highway and leave me there like mom did in 10th grade

pocket full of money
and devoid of all common sense
	siri what is sense
	what is my purpose in life if not to masquerade as an artiste

i'm judging you based on how pimped out your polly pocket mansion is

	and now
i'm judging you based on whether or not you understand dakimakura

dakimakura dakimakura
