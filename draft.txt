i just darkened my own freckles that was the biggest risk i took today ugh what is money what is life how am i even alive
where's the wine can't afford to live in my own apartment so i'm moving in with the internet

if prince charming isn't weak to anime girls in thigh-highs then he's certainly not part of my dystopian fantasy

little brother in 6th grade on the path to become the perfect male clone of yours truly--
	emotional breakdown in the bathroom after first middle school dance:
	how will i ever start a family at this rate?

i told him to take up parkour or program, either way

my life is an emergency and so is yours
	which leads me to believe that i should legally change my name to something threatening like DRAGONSLUT

the office soundtrack is a mix of akira and ambient keyboards
someone sold my coworker his soul at gamestop
and now he's stuck in permanent brock cosplay
god i'm fucking bored of writing about work
and writing at work
please drop me off on the side of the highway and leave me there like mom did in 10th grade

pocket full of money
and devoid of all common sense
	siri what is sense
	what is my purpose in life if not to masquerade as an artiste

i'm judging you based on how pimped out your polly pocket mansion is
	i thought in 5th grade
	and now
i'm judging you based on whether or not you understand dakimakura

dakimakura dakimakura

KAWAII HAS PERISHED press space bar to continue
THE PARTY IS OVER press space bar to continue
SERIOUSLY GET OUT press space bar to continue

i am in a constant state of pancake 
	i mean panic

whether about the government paycheck i'm waiting to get in time for rent or
why the original us dub of sailor moon is so homophobic
	why would anyone want to hide such a cute couple
	michiru and haruka i'm totally with you
	babes like babes it's only natural
	and everyone likes babes with teal hair
	obviously

yeah this shit is real to me
i love anime and i hate you
stop judging me

down with my soul and the man etc etc
impale me on a black censor bar
hentai is forever
there's no such thing as breaking news unless it's that vase i broke during a fit in 3rd grade when mom pissed me off again

**************

so far today

two people have said

a computer could easily replace you

cool thanks




if a computer writes better poetry than me 
so be it

talent scares me and so do people
poets scare me too, but so does lightning and math and biology
and everyday activities including but not limited to everything

i know you are but what am i


									i see the opus in your eye





////////////////
the truth is that computers are the most honest things in the world
///////////////



you don't have to agree with me 
you don't even have to read this poem

repeat after me

i don't like smoking anymore so i don't smoke
i don't like having existential crises anymore so i don't
i don't like math so i don't
i don't like instagram but i do like yours so i look at it sometimes
i don't like critiquing your grammar so stop making mistakes i'm not a tutor anymore
shut up
it's spring break and i'm watching anime like i just don't care

people around the world are unhappy and waking up with hangovers
meanwhile i just tweet




when your life turns into some fanfiction that a 14 year old literally wrote on xanga
it's life, liberty and day drunk in chinatown
wandering in search of sesame pancakes
or sailor moon merchandise offered up for free
a girl can dream

spicy wings in july at boka with watermelon soju for the first time
and drunk at decibel again
drunk again what else is new
with emmett and diego what else is new
the lesson is that some friends are a vacation wasteland
a cruel reality check that i hadn't even been living or eating the right brand of cereal 

summer is a supernova splash
turn the volume up i love this part
it's the positive universe charged up on trader joe's wine for $3 whenever i want
i refer to myself as a technophile in a moment of overwhelming word vomit and kiss a programmer
people watching is essentially lurking internet forums in real life
i relax in a cab
watching a midtown club defiled by pop culture from the window seat 

dumplings steamed to feed me on south 1st
when i come in from the rain
and british men behind me are sloppy and loud
asking me my name and their white shirts dripping wet

never have i ever known how to behave when out alone
or when i have to order food or ask anyone for a favor
my mom told me 'keep to yourself,'
'just nuke a potato' she would say






/////////////
heaven is a place on habbo hotel but not on earth
heaven is definitely not on the bus
it's not in philly and it's not in the matrix
i'd rather go to the matrix than heaven anyways
////////////




a person passes through history on a google search for truth

meanwhile i walk through soho 
which is always like super models-- 
cut to me in sailor moon crop top
reading manga and crying always
en route to kinokuniya

very different from being 12 at contempo with mom in black heels
tall and gorgeous emerging from a jungle of dress racks
the last pair of size 0 jeans with high waist
click clack heels on the floor
rouge red lips and eyelashes for miles
fight evil and dress chic
moms are forever for better or worse

her annual gift was barbie or many barbies
one time i was playing sex with ken
until by accident i ripped ken's leg off
which kind of killed the mood

foreshadowing of phallic rebellion, perhaps
but i'd never even heard of a penis
and instead of a traditional sex talk 
i made out with my pillow and rubbed
sexless dolls together
without the slightest clue

i was in aol cybersex chat rooms before i even knew what sex was

now i know even less about it
my bedroom is an anime bachelor pad
and here i am drinking a cocktail called
'the corpse reviver #2'

i hereby apologize to anyone and everyone i have ever kissed

namaste

please hold on while i randomly read yahoo answers
in search of enlightenment

what could be more zen than the internet

i don't know but my dad did call to ask when my birthday is
	today, i said
	and he said oh right

yup dad, just like the last 22 years

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

last year i partied this year i will party and i will party again next year and next year and

there are many things in this world including but not limited to donuts
and then there's me
admiring my complete collection of britney spears special edition perfume bottles

please excuse me
while   go read nintendo power at this rave
	i say as i ask myself
	what kind of an effect aol pokemon roleplay chatrooms had on my development as a child







>>>>>>>>>>>>>>




i emerged from the womb during happy hour





immediately after being born i was exposed to hell on earth
what i mean to say is that i was born in a hospital,
a unique place known for it's ability to make me cry

the neurosurgery post-op unit nightmare in which i
curl up on the floor and eat stale bread
until no one comes to pick me up



please just hook me up to an IV of coffee





>>>>>>>>




this is the express train to spring break see you later



>>>>>>>>

i got accepted into college but decided it was
time to get drunk and buy millions of dollars of furoku on ebay

wake me up on sunday baby,
i'm your dream girl






/////////////////////
trying to imagine a time before internet and all i see is
people rolling around in this green shit 
lol what the fuck is that anyways, grass?
/////////////////////



i like twix more than i like people



picture me lying down with my laptop in an unmade bed surrounded by food 
and that's an accurate depiction of my life





tildes are flirty
and i'm going to sell my soul on the internet
deal with it




the most essential life wisdom is waiting for you on wikipedia

and it was tuesday on the subway when i overheard the messiah 
'yea I was trying to holla at jasmine 
but talking to her is like talking to a science book. 
she be dropping mad knowledge'



wish i could ride away on a unicorn into the hexadecimal horizon
like my double-spaced dream published on microsoft word

let me idealize reality a little more

i don't believe in words			do you?






///////////////////
wake up and i think to myself 
'wow, consciousness is pretty rad' 
then i pour coffee in me and i'm like
COOL SO THIS IS LIFE
///////////////////




fuck you this is the internet


if love is a hyperlink then click on me as soon as possible





//////////////
macbeth is a super hero
shakespeare is a victim
i'm fictional
and pluto floats dejectedly by


of course




my mom is proof that wearing red makes people feel better
so it's no wonder that pluto is so sad




///////////////
stop pretending
poetry
