i don't believe in words			do you?
americans like fresh fruit, dogs and god
(realization that in fight or flight situations i just tweet)

i am going to cry whether i get into grad school or not

see also, add on craigslist: will sell soul for a PhD

then


when i die
	   bury me in my crop top

set me free on irc

...
this is not just a contempo casual daydream, it's my real life
...


!!!
my poetry professor just compared twitter to the bible
and i couldn't agree more

the bible was pretty much crowdsourced anyways

1

i find myself at a
pivotal once-in-a-lifetime crossroads
in which i am considering the possibility of
selling my soul for a sleeve of
thin mints 

2

my toddler spiderman shirt that says 'sports' 
in cursive font
is a nice complement to my
job security

someone throw me in a ditch 
before i buy these 
shiny american apparel booty shorts

i'm devoted to the worst of the worst
consumerism

go steady with your wallett 
and get that louis vuitton purse
that will go wonderfully stale
on the shelf by volume after volume
of so-called classics
without dust jackets

yeah that's me 
wandering the streets with 
3 bottles of wine in an urban outfitters shopping bag

let's meet in the backs of malls
nationwide
thanking the devil
for the 666th cigarette

coffee is F5 and alcohol is ESC

is it normal to feel this much emotion
over an e-mail

3

i want to build a database for
everyone's sense of humor
so i can query for the good ones
and delete the rest

4

cannot think about sex without also
thinking about inserting
flash drive into
usb port

very erotic

5

it's 2012
and rapid realty
has no apartments located
at the bottom of the sea


why?

6

i'll follow you to the ends of the
google search for
'the end'

because our metadata
has chemistry

or at least above 80%
colocation

7

if i could have anything
in this world
it would be glasses
with an ascii art prescription 

wanna see everything in unicode

hey babe, your eyes are 
8bit and 
i have a LOT of bandwidth

wanna date?

7

recurring dream where
i'm a bitch on twitter

the things i aspire to though,
seriously

8

the suburbs are interesting. 
there's a lot of land lines
and porn
and kids called junior,
there's a lot of verified suburban moms
subscribed to housekeeping
and alarm clocks set to snooze.
alarm clock snoozing rebels.

chase me down the street to
a cool pond and
we can swim there.
bring your laptop and we'll
ftp love letters--
give me a gun and i'll
shoot your
laptop to bits after like it's no big deal.

say good night love
to the internet
because it's more important
to you than me.
